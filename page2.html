    <h2>Who is Sailor Moon? </h2>
    <p>Sailor Moon is the lead protagonist in the 90s anime (Japanese cartoon). The anime is a development of the original manga (Japanese comics), written by Naoko Takeuchi. Sailor Moon (whose non-superheroine name is Usagi) is a normal adolescent girl who can't quite balance studying, food, games and crushes... until one day, a talking cat informs Usagi she is a Moon Princess, capable of magical powers! What ensues is the power of female friendship, love, support, and adventure. </p>

    <h2>Inspirational Sailor Says Images</h2>
    <p>Sailor Moon is all about bringing you up when you're feeling down. After all, Usagi's typical day includes missing breakfast (dang snooze button), tripping on the way to school, a bad report card, and relentless teasing from an older mysterious guy (just pull her pigtails already!) These pictures are lessons Sailor Moon has learnt, and now you can too!</p>

       <h5>
      Dear Sailor Moon,
        <p>
      Lately, I've been feeling like there's too much bad and not                enough good in the world. I know it's a general thing, but I               feel totally overwhelmed, all the time. What can I do to make myself       feel better?
        </p>
       </h5>
          <h3>
        Dear 'too much bad',
             <p>
             I think that you writing in shows just how much good there is in the world already! Although it's easy to feel overwhelmed by all the people, places and things going on around you, you've gotta remember that you're just one person! "Treat others the way <em>you</em> want to be treated!" That's the first and best place to start (although I'm sure you're already doing that!)
          </h3>
